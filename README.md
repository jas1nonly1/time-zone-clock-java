TIME ZONE CLOCK

The project is a software application built in Java to deal with the time difference problem face by people travelling or working overseas. The GUI of the application is quite clear, simple, consistent and easier to use for any kind of user varying from a non-technical person to a high-tech computer professional. TIME ZONE CLOCK serves as a useful application to have a check on time zone related things. In addition, we have added some utilities such as Alarm, Stopwatch and Timer for the user to make use of this application in their everyday life.

The detailed description of the GUI has been demonstrated below:

The application starts by a Welcoming Screen displaying the name of application with four primary options to be used by the user. 
The very first option is a “World Clock”. By simply clicking on the button, the user will be redirected to a page displaying a dropdown list of countries. 
The user can select any country of his/her choice for which he/she would want to get Time Zone related information. On selecting a particular country, it displays the current time, temperature and weather of that country. 
Along with this, it also displays the current time in user’s country and the time difference between both countries. 
After closing this window, the user can again go to main menu, where he can select second available option i.e. “Alarm”. On clicking “Alarm” button, a new window appears where the user can set a new alarm. On clicking “New Alarm” button, the user will be provided with a set of fields to be filled out to set a new alarm such as Alarm Name, Time, List of important things to do, Snooze time.
The user can either save the alarm by clicking “Save” button or cancel it by clicking “Cancel” button. On closing the window, user will again come to main window where he can select other useful option i.e. “Stopwatch”. On clicking “Stopwatch” button, a new window will appear to use the stopwatch with options such as Start, Pause, Stop and Resume. 
The user can enter desired time to be set for stopwatch and then choose any required option from those mentioned before. On closing this window, the user will again be redirected to main window where he can choose the last option i.e. “Timer”. On clicking “Timer” button, a new window will appear where the user can enter desired hours, minutes and seconds and then click on “Start” button to start the timer. There are also available options to Pause, Resume and Stop the timer.
The whole GUI has been built using Java Swing. The functionality of the application is maintained and enhanced by the use of various JAVA concepts such as Arrays and Threads. 



Instructions to use
The main file from where application starts is “TimeZoneClock.java”. However the project could be directly imported into eclipse and could be run using Run option.
